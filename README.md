# decision-making-statements-
AIM :-<br>
To study and implement C++ decision making statements<br>

SOFTWARE USED :- VS code<br>

THEORY:-<br>
if ,else if , and else} are basic decision-making statements in C++ that are used to regulate a program's flow based on conditions.<br>
Expressions that return Boolean values (true or false) are evaluated by these statements. If the condition is true, a block of code is executed by the ifexpression.<br>
In case the previousifwas false, aelse ifstatement is used to verify another condition after theif. <br>
If any of the conditions listed above are false, a block of code is executed by the else` expression. <br>
Because of these components, branching logic is possible, enabling the program to make decisions and run various code paths on demand.<br>
When decision-making statements are used effectively, they explicitly define many execution scenarios based on changing conditions, improving program flexibility, readability, and maintainability.

Algorithim :- <br>
1.Start<br>

2.Declare Variables:<br>

 -Declare num1 and num2 as floating-point numbers to store the input numbers.<br>
-Declare choice as an integer to store the user's choice of operation.<br>
3.Input Numbers:<br>

-Prompt the user to enter the first number and read it into num1.<br>
-Prompt the user to enter the second number and read it into num2.<br>
4.Display Operation Menu:<br>

-Display a menu with the following options for the user to choose from:<br>
-Addition<br>
-Subtraction<br>
-Multiplication<br>
-Division<br>
5.Input Operation Choice:<br>

-Prompt the user to enter their choice of operation and read it into choice.<br>
6.Perform Operation Based on Choice:<br>

-If choice is 1, then:<br>
 --Calculate the sum of num1 and num2.<br>
 --Display the result of the addition.<br>
-Else if choice is 2, then:<br>
--Calculate the difference of num1 and num2.<br>
--Display the result of the subtraction.<br>
-Else if choice is 3, then:<br>
--Calculate the product of num1 and num2.<br>
--Display the result of the multiplication.<br>
-Else if choice is 4, then:<br>
--If num2 is not equal to 0, then:<br>
--Calculate the division of num1 by num2.<br>
--Display the result of the division.<br>
-Else:<br>
--Display an error message indicating division by zero is undefined.<br>
-Else:<br>
--Display an error message indicating that the choice is invalid.<br>
7.End<br>

conclusion : - <br>
We learnt about conditional statements and their use case <br>
